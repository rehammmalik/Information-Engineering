                <h3>Electronic system for monitoring electronic exams via the Internet</h3>
                <p>It is a tool used to ensure the integrity of exams and prevent cheating during remote exams.
                     Here are some of the key features of these systems: Webcam monitoring: Webcams are used to monitor and record test takers during the exam.
                      The recordings can be reviewed later to detect any suspicious behavior. Screen sharing: The test taker’s screen activity is recorded to ensure that no unauthorized resources or applications are being used.
                       Biometric verification: Technologies such as fingerprints or facial recognition are used to verify the identity of the test taker.
                        Artificial intelligence: Artificial intelligence algorithms are used to analyze behavior patterns and report any unusual or suspicious activity during exams.
                        Browser restrictions: Some systems block the use of other browser tabs or applications during the exam to prevent cheating.
                         These systems help provide a safe and fair environment for online exams, ensuring the integrity of academic assessments</p>
